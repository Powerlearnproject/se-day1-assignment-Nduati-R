Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It's the application of engineerig principles to build, maintain and deploy a software.
It ensures scalability,efficiency,improved UI/UX experience and innovation.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Object oriented programming(OOP)-improved maintainability by structuring it in form of objects.
2.Structured programming-introduced modular design.
3.Agile Methodologists-supported iterative development, collaboration and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Identify and document both functional and non-functional stakeholder needs.
Design: Develop comprehensive system designs—including architecture, data models, and component diagrams—to meet the requirements.
Implementation (Coding): Transform design specs into code using best practices, coding standards, and version control.
Testing: Ensure the software fulfills all requirements and is defect-free through various testing methods (unit, integration, system).
Deployment: Launch the software in production environments, which may involve server provisioning, containerization, or cloud deployment.
Maintenance: Continuously update the software by fixing bugs, adding features, and enhancing performance based on user feedback.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next. It's ideal for clearly defined requirements e.g infrastructure systems where details are important.
Agile methodology however is iterative, incremental process that delivers work in short cycles thus alloeing regular feedbacks throughout the project.It's works best in dynamic projects e.g developing a mobile app.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer: Maintains and programs the software.
2.QA Engineer: Ensures quality through testing.
3.Project manager: they plan, coordinate and oversees delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
DEs consolidate coding, debugging, and testing into one platform, significantly boosting productivity and streamlining workflows. E.g Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA. VCSs manage code changes, facilitate team collaboration, and maintain a history of revisions. This is crucial for error tracking and coordinated development.E.g Git and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers often encounter challenges such as evolving requirements, technical debt, tight deadlines, complex codebases, and communication gaps. To overcome these, strategies include adopting Agile methodologies for flexibility, scheduling regular refactoring sessions, using effective estimation and sprint planning, implementing modular architectures, and leveraging collaboration tools and code reviews for improved teamwork.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing: Tests individual components.
2.Integration testing: Verifies interactions between components.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Propmt engineering is the art of designing effective prompts for AI. It improves accuracy,efficincy and customization.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
The vague prompt could be something like: “Tell me about Paris.” The improved version would be: “What are the top three tourist attractions in Paris for a first-time visitor interested in history and art?” This version is more specific because it gives clear context and narrows down the focus, specifying the target audience and what the user wants — namely, recommendations related to history and art. This results in more relevant and precise answers, reducing ambiguity.
