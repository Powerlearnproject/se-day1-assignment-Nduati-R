Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the structured approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It ensures that software is scalable, reliable, and efficient—crucial in today’s tech-driven world. From banking systems to social media, everything runs on software!

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

(i) Birth of High-Level Languages (1950s-60s) – Assembly was replaced by languages like FORTRAN and COBOL, making coding easier.
(ii) Structured Programming (1970s) – Introduced better coding practices (e.g., modular code) to improve maintainability.
(iii) Agile & DevOps (2000s-Present) – Moved from rigid planning (Waterfall) to flexible, iterative development (Agile), with DevOps improving automation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Define project goals.
Analysis – Gather requirements.
Design – Create architecture & UI/UX.
Implementation – Actual coding.
Testing – Debugging and quality checks.
Deployment – Releasing the product.
Maintenance – Updates & fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next. It's ideal for clearly defined requirements e.g infrastructure systems where details are important.
Agile methodology however is iterative, incremental process that delivers work in short cycles thus alloeing regular feedbacks throughout the project.It's works best in dynamic projects e.g developing a mobile app.

Waterfall: Sequential, structured, good for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government contracts).
Agile: Iterative, flexible, ideal for evolving needs (e.g., startups).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes & maintains code.
QA Engineer – Tests & ensures quality.
Project Manager – Plans, coordinates, and ensures deadlines are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

DEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ) streamline coding with features like debugging and syntax highlighting.
VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub) track changes, prevent code conflicts, and enable collaboration.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers often encounter challenges such as evolving requirements, technical debt, tight deadlines, complex codebases, and communication gaps. To overcome these, strategies include adopting Agile methodologies for flexibility, scheduling regular refactoring sessions, using effective estimation and sprint planning, implementing modular architectures, and leveraging collaboration tools and code reviews for improved teamwork.

Scope Creep – Define clear project goals from the start.
Buggy Code – Use automated testing & code reviews.
Tight Deadlines – Follow Agile practices for flexibility

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components.
Integration Testing – Ensures modules work together.
System Testing – Tests the complete system.
Acceptance Testing – Validates if the software meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting effective inputs for AI models to get accurate, meaningful responses. It’s essential for improving AI interactions in chatbots, coding assistants, and search engines.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague: Tell me about AI.
Improved: Give me a brief overview of AI, including its key applications in healthcare and finance.
Why? The improved prompt is clear (specific topic), concise (direct request), and contextual (focus areas).
